## General Information
- A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. 
- The project will be helping the company in taking correct data-driven decisions to invest in house.
- Here, I have built a model for the prediction of the price for houses with the of different features. It will be used by the management to predict the actual price of houses. So, They can accordingly do their invetment decisions.
- For this analysis, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.
